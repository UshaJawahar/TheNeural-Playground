# Implementation Summary: Delete APIs for Guest System

## Overview

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive set of DELETE APIs for the guest system that allows users to delete trained models from Google Cloud Storage (GCS) and manage examples under different labels. The implementation includes both backend APIs and frontend utilities.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Backend API Endpoints (in `backend/app/api/guests/guests.py`)

#### A. Delete Trained Model
- **Endpoint:** `DELETE /api/guests/projects/{project_id}/model`
- **Purpose:** Deletes trained model files from GCS and resets project status
- **Features:**
  - Validates guest session ownership
  - Deletes model file from Google Cloud Storage
  - Updates project status to "draft"
  - Comprehensive error handling and logging

#### B. Delete Examples by Label
- **Endpoint:** `DELETE /api/guests/projects/{project_id}/examples/{label}`
- **Purpose:** Deletes all examples under a specific label (e.g., all "happy" examples)
- **Features:**
  - Removes all examples with the specified label
  - Updates dataset record count
  - Removes label from labels list if no examples remain
  - Detailed response with before/after counts

#### C. Delete Specific Example
- **Endpoint:** `DELETE /api/guests/projects/{project_id}/examples/{label}/{example_index}`
- **Purpose:** Deletes a specific example by its index within a label group
- **Features:**
  - Deletes specific example by index
  - Validates index range
  - Returns preview of deleted example
  - Updates dataset record count

### 2. Frontend Utilities (in `frontend/lib/delete-apis.ts`)

#### A. API Functions
- `deleteTrainedModel()` - Calls the model deletion API
- `deleteExamplesByLabel()` - Calls the label deletion API
- `deleteSpecificExample()` - Calls the specific example deletion API

#### B. React Hook
- `useDeleteOperations()` - Provides loading states and error handling
- Manages loading states for each operation type
- Handles success and error callbacks
- Provides clean error handling

### 3. Example Component (in `frontend/components/DeleteExamplesExample.tsx`)

A complete React component that demonstrates how to use the delete APIs:
- Shows examples grouped by label
- Provides buttons to delete models, all examples of a label, or specific examples
- Displays success/error messages
- Shows loading states during operations
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

### 4. Testing (in `backend/test_delete_apis.py`)

Comprehensive test suite that:
- Tests all three API endpoints
- Uses mocked dependencies
- Validates response formats
- Ensures proper error handling
- All tests pass successfully

### 5. Documentation

- **`DELETE_APIS_README.md`** - Complete API documentation with examples
- **`IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`** - This summary document

## Key Features

### Security & Validation
- **Session Validation:** All endpoints require valid guest session IDs
- **Ownership Verification:** Projects must belong to the requesting session
- **Input Validation:** Proper validation of all parameters

### Error Handling
- **HTTP Status Codes:** Appropriate status codes for different error types
- **Detailed Error Messages:** Clear error descriptions for debugging
- **Graceful Degradation:** Handles GCS errors without failing completely

### Logging
- **Comprehensive Logging:** All operations are logged with detailed information
- **Audit Trail:** Complete record of all delete operations
- **Debug Information:** Session validation, project verification, and operation results

### GCS Integration
- **Direct GCS Operations:** Uses Google Cloud Storage client for file deletion
- **Path Parsing:** Automatically parses GCS paths to extract bucket and blob information
- **Error Handling:** Graceful handling of GCS-specific errors

## API Response Formats

### Delete Model Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Trained model deleted successfully",
  "project_id": "proj_123",
  "deleted_gcs_path": "bucket-name/models/model_123.pkl"
}
```

### Delete Examples Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Successfully deleted 3 examples with label 'happy'",
  "project_id": "proj_123",
  "label": "happy",
  "examples_deleted": 3,
  "examples_before": 5,
  "examples_after": 2
}
```

### Delete Specific Example Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Successfully deleted example with label 'happy'",
  "project_id": "proj_123",
  "label": "happy",
  "example_index": 0,
  "deleted_example": "I am feeling very happy today!",
  "examples_remaining": 4
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Backend (Python)
```python
import requests

# Delete trained model
response = requests.delete(
    f"http://localhost:8000/api/guests/projects/{project_id}/model",
    params={"session_id": session_id}
)

# Delete examples by label
response = requests.delete(
    f"http://localhost:8000/api/guests/projects/{project_id}/examples/{label}",
    params={"session_id": session_id}
)
```

### Frontend (TypeScript/React)
```typescript
import { useDeleteOperations } from '../lib/delete-apis';

const { deleteModel, deleteExamplesByLabel, isDeletingModel } = useDeleteOperations(
  (message) => console.log('Success:', message),
  (error) => console.error('Error:', error)
);

// Delete model
await deleteModel(projectId, sessionId);

// Delete examples by label
await deleteExamplesByLabel(projectId, 'happy', sessionId);
```

## Testing Results

All tests pass successfully:
- âœ… `delete_trained_model` test passed
- âœ… `delete_examples_by_label` test passed  
- âœ… `delete_specific_example` test passed
- ðŸ“Š Test Results: 3/3 tests passed

## Dependencies

### Backend
- `fastapi` - Web framework
- `google-cloud-storage` - GCS operations
- `google-cloud-firestore` - Database operations

### Frontend
- `react` - UI framework
- `typescript` - Type safety
- `tailwindcss` - Styling (for example component)

## Next Steps

The implementation is complete and ready for use. Consider:

1. **Integration Testing:** Test with real GCS buckets and Firestore databases
2. **Frontend Integration:** Integrate the delete APIs into existing project management interfaces
3. **User Experience:** Add confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
4. **Monitoring:** Add metrics and monitoring for delete operations
5. **Backup Strategy:** Consider implementing soft deletes or backup mechanisms

## Conclusion

The delete APIs provide a complete solution for managing trained models and examples in the guest system. They include proper authentication, validation, error handling, and comprehensive logging. The frontend utilities make it easy to integrate these APIs into React applications with proper loading states and error handling.
